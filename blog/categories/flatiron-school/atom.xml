<p>
One thing that has always fascinated me about programming is the ability of programmers to become multilingual with their languages. You might know Ruby, but you also know quite a bit of SQL, or JS, or HTML, or even the nuances of using GitHub. The drive to learn more in order to build and communicate more is at the heart of the programming community itself. Even the structure and layout of a particular language, like Ruby, is governed by its own design language. Why then is it so freaking hard to find a nicely designed programming presentation on <a href= “http://speakerdeck.com”>Speaker Deck?</a>  Seriously, I just read 13 decks and only 3 of them were acceptably nice.</p>

<hr>




<h2>Design is a Language We All Speak</h2>


<p>You might think that design is for designers, but the truth is: we all know good design when we see it. Good design is simple, arresting, succinct, and above all communicates a SINGLE message. The same is true for a presentation: each slide should be communicating one thing. If you can’t sum up what that picture of you racing squirrels on slide 7 is doing in one short sentence – take it out. Or better yet, write that one short sentence and use it on your slide.</p>

<p> <hr></p>

<h2>Blackout the Rainbow</h2>


<p>Quit using every color Newton gave you. If you need inspiration for color swatches try <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/explore/most-favorite/?time=month">Adobe Kuler</a> or if you hate Adobe, use <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com">Color Lovers.</a> The same lesson for colors should be applied to fonts. If you use more than two or three fonts (one for headlines, one for body, and one for emphasis) you&rsquo;re doing it wrong. If you need ideas for font pairings checkout: <a href="http://ifontyou.com">I Font You.</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2> What the What with the Gmail </h2>


<p>After my first experiment with Ruby and Arduino, I wanted to try writing a sketch that would build off of the code I had written from the blinking LED test. Using the blinking LED as an indicator, I thought it would be interesting to see if I could get my Ardunio talking with Gmail to alert me if I had any unread inbox messages. After doing some research, I found a Ruby gem called Gmail that allows me to do just that.</p>

<hr>




<h2> Requiring the Right Gems </h2>


<p>Here we&rsquo;re going to set up the sketch with the gems we&rsquo;ll be running.</p>

<p><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">require &lsquo;bundler/setup&rsquo;
</span><span class="line">require &lsquo;gmail&rsquo;
</span><span class="line">require &lsquo;dino&rsquo;
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></p>

<hr>




<h2> Board in the USA </h2>


<p>Dino requires us to define our board, tell it that we&rsquo;ll be inputing and outputing data, and tell it that we&rsquo;re using a serial connection (since my Ardunio is hooked up via USB). Next, we&rsquo;ll be defining our LED variable, which should be easy since it was in the previous sketch.Note: Dino also offers a good directory full of example code for setting up any given component.</p>

<h4>Setting up dino</h4>


<p><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">board = Dino::Board.new(Dino::TxRx::Serial.new)
</span><span class="line">led = Dino::Components::Led.new(pin: 13, board: board)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></p>

<hr>




<h2> You've Got Mail </h2>


<p>In the next few lines of code we: call on Gmail to let us access our inbox, check if our inbox is empty, set the led variable to a resting state, and define a variable equal to the number of unread emails. Note: In the code listed below, you&rsquo;d actually pass in your real email address and password.
<figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">Gmail.connect(&ldquo;<a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x75;&#115;&#x65;&#114;&#64;&#103;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#x75;&#115;&#x65;&#x72;&#64;&#103;&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;password&rdquo;) do |gmail|
<span class="line">led.off
</span><span class="line">puts &ldquo;Total Unread Emails: #{gmail.inbox.count(:unread)}&rdquo;
</span><span class="line">has_unread = gmail.inbox.count(:unread) !=0
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></p>

<hr>




<h2>Ruby Slippers</h2>


<p>Now that we have access to our inbox, we can finish up this sketch by writing an if statement to blink our led when our inbox is not at zero.</p>

<p><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">if has_unread != 0
</span><span class="line">[:on, :off].cycle do |switch|
</span><span class="line">led.send(switch)
</span><span class="line">sleep 0.5
</span><span class="line">end
</span><span class="line">end
</span><span class="line">end
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></p>

<hr>




<h2>Next Steps</h2>


<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to take this further by:</p>

<ul><li>Writting in a delay and loop so that the sketch runs every 5-10 min</li> 
<li> Adding an rgbLED so that I can light up a red LED when the inbox is full and a green LED when the inbox is empty.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2> The Beginning </h2>


<p>Coming from a design background, I have a hard time understanding how something works or its purpose until I can see it applied to a real life situation. This is how I feel about learning Ruby. While I&rsquo;m becoming more familiar with the language day by day, I still needed an example of a practical application of it in order to wrap my head around when it&rsquo;s used.</p>

<p>In order to bring it all together, I decided to turn to an area I have a little bit of know-how in: physical computing. Ever since I was a kid, I&rsquo;ve wanted to take over the world – and that dream starts by having your very own robot army. While I don&rsquo;t have a large army to date, I have made a few small models with various microcontrollers, specifically with the ever popular Arduino. But, the Ardunio platform is based on a language (and environment) called Wiring, which is in turn based on C++ – quite a bit different from our pretty happy friend Ruby.</p>

<hr>


<h2> Experiment 1 </h2>


<p>So, I did a bit of research and found that someone had built a gem called dino last year for the exact purpose of running ruby sketches on your Arduino. After installing the dino gem and hooking up the Ardunio, all that was left was to write a simple sketch and watch what happend.</p>

<p>By writing some Ruby and following a few syntax rules dino lays out, you can get an LED blinking in no time. And while this is a little underwhelming, I&rsquo;m hoping to create more interesting projects with this pairing as I begin to learn more.</p>
